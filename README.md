<p>This is my own take on Rasberry Pi Reference Configuration for Raspberry PI <a href="https://clusterhat.com/">Mini Cluster On Board</a> setup (4 x Rasberry Zero on top of the Cluster HAT plugged in to Rasberry Pi 3B).<br>
There is only one small difference within this project - I'm not going to use the Raspbian/Debian here. As all my day to day operations are run on the Funtoo (desktop) and Gentoo (servers), and I prefer that mindset better - I'll try to rewrite and fit all those scripts written for Raspian.<br> Well at least I'll try and tinker with it... Who knows where this will end?</p>

I am a big fan of this little board and this repository exist only as a specific reference for fitting Funtoo/Gentoo linux based on Manual Software Setup written by Chris Burton <a href="https://clusterhat.com/setup-software">here</a>.
