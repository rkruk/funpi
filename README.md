<h1 align="center"> Raspberry Pi Mini Cluster Setup</h1>
<br>
<br>
This is a Rasberry Pi Reference Configuration for mini cluster setup (4 x Rasberry Zero on top of the Cluster HAT plugged in to Rasberry Pi 3B).
The difference here is one - I'm not going to use a Debian here like everybody else. All my day to day operations are run on the Funtoo desktop and Gentoo servers, so as you may guess I'm going to use that on the RPi too. At least I'll try to implement that, rewrite cluster configuration (based on Debian) for Funtoo.
