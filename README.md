<p>This repository exist only as my own reference configuration for Raspberry PI <a href="https://clusterhat.com/">Mini Cluster On Board</a> setup (4 x Rasberry Zero on top of the Cluster HAT plugged in to Rasberry Pi 3B).<br><br>
<b>Here be dragons.</b><br>
There are few things I'll try to do differently than the orignal author did. Things will probably go very messyand buggy (I did burn few Raspberry boards in the past...).<br> 
So...feel warned. Do not try and reproduce whatever I did here. Or face broken hardware, corrupted memory cards and anger of Zeus.<br>
Why this project is different? - I'm not going to use the Raspbian/Debian here. Simple. As all my day to day operations are run on the Funtoo (desktop) and Gentoo (servers), and I prefer that mindset better - I'll try (sic) to review, research differences, rewrite and fit all those scripts written for Raspian.<br> Well at least I'll try and tinker with it... Who knows where this will end? At this moment this task seems enormous for me.. but hey I will try it. OK?</p>

I am a big fan of this little board and this repository exist only as a specific reference for fitting Funtoo/Gentoo linux based on Manual Software Setup written by Chris Burton <a href="https://clusterhat.com/setup-software">here</a>.</p>.
